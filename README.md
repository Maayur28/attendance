## About The Project

![Portfolio](https://res.cloudinary.com/mayur28/image/upload/v1631347769/responsive_s8ttca.png)

As you have already know from my [portfolio](https://www.mayuragarwal.in/) that my focussed is on creating the user-friendly websites that deliver over the top experience. It delivers clean and easy-to-use user-experience with excellent responsiveness. You can log attendance and modify it easily. Some key points which I keep in mind while developing the projects:

- Must provide clean and easy-to-use experience.
- Must provide better responsiveness for all screen sizes.

### Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
